Data Preprocessing System for Machine Learning
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses common challenges such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By performing effective data preprocessing, this project aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning applications.

Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Data Exploration: Explore and clean the dataset, perform statistical analysis, and handle any inconsistencies in column names.
Data Cleaning: Address missing or inappropriate values, remove duplicates, and treat outliers effectively.
Data Analysis: Filter and analyze the data based on specific conditions, and visualize it using appropriate charts.
Data Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques.
Feature Scaling: Apply scaling techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to the features.
Dataset
The dataset is a collection of data from various individuals, including features like age, salary, and other attributes. The dataset can be accessed via the following link:

Key Components and Tasks
1. Data Exploration
Task: Explore the data by listing unique values in each feature and determine their lengths. Perform statistical analysis and rename columns if necessary.

Method:

Inspect the first few rows of the dataset.
Get unique values and their lengths for each feature.
Perform basic statistical analysis (e.g., mean, median, min, max, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning
Task: Handle missing and inappropriate values, remove duplicates, and find outliers. Replace any zero value in the "age" column with NaN and treat null values in all columns using suitable strategies (e.g., removal or replacement with mean, median, or mode).

Method:

Identify missing or inappropriate values.
Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
Remove duplicate rows from the dataset.
Replace zero values in the "age" column with NaN.
Handle outliers using statistical methods.
3. Data Analysis
Task: Filter the data where age > 40 and salary < 5000, plot the chart with age and salary, and count the number of people from each place, representing this information visually.

Method:

Apply the given filter condition on age and salary.
Plot a chart showing the relationship between age and salary.
Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of individuals from different places.
4. Data Encoding
Task: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Method:

Use one-hot encoding for nominal categorical features.
Use label encoding for ordinal categorical features.
Prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms by converting categorical data into a numeric format.
5. Feature Scaling
Task: After encoding the features, perform scaling using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

Method:

Standardize the features using StandardScaler (to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1).
Normalize the features using MinMaxScaler (to scale the features to a range of [0, 1]).
